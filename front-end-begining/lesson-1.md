# Lesson 1

In this lesson I should introduce to the student about the career path.

Student needs to try to form habits on learning, this will help him in the career path.

Also it is important to have some resources to look for help in the internet like Stack overflow or HTML5 Rocks.

About sessions, I as a mentor should help on:

- Clarifying ideas or skills.

- Help on questions about course material or projects.

- Give feedback on projects.

- Setting up goals for the following week.

As a good resource always tell the student to see about slack-students channel, there is always help on course material / projects.
