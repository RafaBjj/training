# Lesson 3

This lesson is about working with a shopping list app in order to practice all we had learnt during the last lessons, jquery and javascript.

The task should be done by first looking at design and wireframe of the app.

And then student should complete the app by adding the CRUD behaviors needed.

Ask the student to do small commits in order to have small features done, if student do the Creation of an element to the list then he should do a commit for this new feature to the app, and so on...
