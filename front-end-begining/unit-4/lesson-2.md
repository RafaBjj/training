# Lesson 2

Student should go through a challenge using stackoverflow API, in this case it is a reputation builder.

- The user submit a topic of his interest, and it displays results related to that topic.

So the student should fork a repo, and then it actually works on adding this call to API. Finally student can work on templates like mustache.js or handlebars.js.

Finally there is one more challenge adding a new feature. Student should:

- Users can submit a topic they want to find top answerers for on Stack Overflow.

- The app makes an AJAX call to the appropriate endpoint on the StackExchange API (there are a few hints below).

- The DOM is updated with information about top answerers (if any) after the response is returned.

# Goal

Student should go through Tic Tac Toe, and Logo Search.
