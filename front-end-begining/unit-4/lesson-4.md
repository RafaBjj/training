# Lesson 4

- The application must make use of a third-party API and use the results to change the DOM.You will need to choose the API you wish to use and how you will use the data.

- You must plan your app in detail before you start building. Send the sketch to your mentor so he or she can flag potential problems with it – such as data limits or technology requirements – before you start building.

- Try making your project responsive using media queries, as you learned in unit 1.

The student should think on a project and use different APIs in order to achieve results. In this case the student should think on something.

If it have no Idea propose google maps + foursquare and work on his neighbour, integrating those values on the places he/she likes more.


Create a balsamiq or Pencil wireframe tool, share with me.

Code the HTML + CSS first.

Then go for javascript logic.

Finally work on integrating the API.
