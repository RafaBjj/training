- Be able to model real world things and processes

- Know how to debug JavaScript in the browser

Ask the student to explain what is a SPA?.

# Lesson 1

- How to use variables, operators, and conditional logic to write simple programs

- How to execute Javascript as well as debug using Dev Tools

Explain the use of javascript by first explaining the needs. Show a bit of pseudo programming and express your self as a programmer documenting your needs and resolving those needs.

Going from needs to creating a model that solves that problem to writing in a computer lenguage as javascript the way we solve it.

Explain a bit more about debugging, and write some examples in console so the student can see some things needed. Explain the odds related to comparisons, truthy / falsy values, true, false, and also a bit of maths.
