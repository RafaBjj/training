# Lesson 1

### Data Structures

Explain the need on structures. Also give a bit more intro about the needs on working with each one with some example.

When working on those examples bring to light how working with one case would be a good approach and in some other cases would be a bad approach, why? work explaining the access to data of the structure.

Doing this student would understand in a better way why Big O notation is important when working with this information and the correct structure to each problem.
